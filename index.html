            <h3> The Beginning </h3>
         </article>
         <p> This section is all about me. There is no good place to start. I am 34 years old, I have 5
            siblings and currently finishing my bachelors degree. 
         </p>

            <h3> The Middle </h3>
         </article>
         <p> I went to college right out of High School. I was expected to graduate in 2011. After 3 years 
            in school, life happened. I got engaged and left school. I moved to North Dakota to support my fiancee
            at the time while she was in graduate school. The idea was once she was finished I would go back. 
            Needless to say, things did not work out. 
         </p>
         <p> Now back in Illinois I worked several jobs, mostly restaurants, but it was not something
            that was sustainable. I got a job with a previous coworker in a sales company the next state over, Missouri.
            I worked in that industry for 10 years. That brings us to the present time.

            <h3> The Present </h3>
         </article>
         <p> I recently switched career industries, from sales to IT. My goal is to be a software developer. 
            I am currently engaged and attending school in the process of finishing my bachelors in computer information
            systems. I am attending LaunchCode to gain the skills to help me into the development field.
